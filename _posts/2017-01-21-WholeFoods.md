For my third project at Metis I looked at county level data from the American Community Survey (ACS) as potential indicators for whether or not that county had a Whole Foods.

I feel one of the stigmas about Whole Foods is that they have narrow focus in terms of who they are marketing towards. By looking at demographic data from the ACS I hoped to find what demographics served as indicators for Whole Foods locations.
In addition to demographic data, I also looked at the locations of some related and competing buisnesses thinking that maybe the customer bases would overlap. 
Some companies even specifcally open location nearby related companies hoping to steal some of their customers away.
For a time Long John Silvers tended to open restaurants right next to McDonalds and marketed itself as a "burger alternative" hoping to steal McD goers who were tired of the big mac. 
Store locations I used in my model were those for Starbucks, McDonalds, Target, Walmart, and Trader Joes.

As apposed to basic descriptive analysis, building a predictive model had a few benefits:
  - Going through over 100 demographic statistics by hand is unweildy even with computer assistance. A Predictive model yields information on which features are most relevant to it's predictions and helps focus attention on the most salient demographics
  - Looking at counties that my model got wrong could be areas worth exploring as possible locations for new Whole Foods Stores
