As if movie prices in the city aren't enough from dettering me from going to the movies, spending 2 weeks scraping the web for all the different stats on every possible movie certainly has me sick of the whole industry and makes me never want to go to the cinema again. If you don't know what scraping the web means, heres some background: 

When you go to a website it's usually no big deal to just look at the page with your human eyes, click on links with your human hand, and interpret basic information on the webpage using your human brain. Computers, however, don't have hands, eyes, or brains and when you want them to go to a bunch of websites (say movie pages on boxofficemojo.com) and collect a bunch of information for you (say the Total Gross for each movie), it's REAAALLLY  arduous to tell them exactly what you want (and believe me, they need to know EXACTLY). Really the computer is just super insecure. I might tell my computer, "Go to the movie page for 'Star Wars - A New Hope'" and the computer responds, "OMG THERE IS NO PAGE FOR 'Star Wars - A New Hope'! THE UNIVERSE IS ENDING!" and then deletes all the information I had collected up to that point. My bad computer, I should have told you I was looking for "Star Wars: A New Hope" (with a colon... not a dash). Then, once we're actually on the correct page, our conversation looks like this:

me: "Hey computer, tell me how much this movie made"
computer: "Ok... how do I do that"
me: "Just look for the dollar sign ("$") followed by a really large number
computer: "Oh ok, the movie made '$129,324,234$132,213,543$111,245,322$134,553,333$99,433,234'"
me: "uhh... that looks like 5 different amounts. Were any of those preceded by the words 'Total Gross'"
computer: "no"
me: "Were any of those preceded by 'Total Gross:' (with a colon):
computer "yes all of them"
me: "ugghhhh what came before 'Total Gross:' in each case
computer: "Domestic, Foreign, Worldwide, Week, Budget"
me: "ok get the one
