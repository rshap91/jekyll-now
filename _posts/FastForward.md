As if movie prices in the city aren't enough from dettering me from going to the movies, spending 2 weeks scraping the web for all the different stats on every possible movie certainly has me sick of the whole industry and makes me never want to go to the cinema again. If you don't know what scraping the web means, heres some background: 

When you go to a website it's usually no big deal to just look at the page with your human eyes, click on links with your human hand, and interpret basic information on the webpage using your human brain. Computers, however, don't have hands, eyes, or brains and when you want them to go to a bunch of websites (say movie pages on boxofficemojo.com) and collect a bunch of information for you (say the Total Gross for each movie), it's REAAALLLY  arduous to tell them exactly what you want (and believe me, they need to know EXACTLY). For starters, you have to talk to them in the language of html (the language used to build websites). Here's a snippet of some html from www.imdb.com. I'd post the whole thing... except the html used to create the imdb homepage is 60 pages long!
