### My First Post
Into week 2 of Metis Data Science Bootcamp... and the water keeps rising. I am reminded very much of a song I used to listen to when I was a child which was a Shel Silverstein poem set to music.

Given that we are doing all of our work in the python programming language, the song seems more relevant than I would like.


Our first project was getting to learn pandas to wrangle mta Turnstile data to find trends in ridership. Given that I was both familiar with pandas and familiar with the dataset (not just because i'm from New York, but because i've actually looked at the data before), I expected the project to be a breeze. This was not the case. Feeling audacious, I tried to revisit the magical "Alice in Wonderland" world of d3.js in hopes of creating a nice visualization of traffic around the city. Obstacles started to pile up and before I knew it, it was Thursday night (the project was due Friday) and I hadn't really come up with anything. Feeling defeated, I met with my group mates mostly empty handed, and each of us had had the same problem. We tried to do something clever and flashy instead of something basic and coherent, and had nothing to show for it. Thursday night was a late night with more red bull than I'd care to admit, but by Friday afternoon we had wrangled the data, performed a rudimentary analysis, and came to some simple, reasonable conclusions.
