### My First Post
Into week 2 of Metis Data Science Bootcamp... and the water keeps rising. I am reminded very much of a song I used to listen to when I was a child which was a Shel Silverstein poem set to music.

Given that we are doing all of our work in the python programming language, the song seems more relevant than I would like.


Our first project was getting to learn pandas to wrangle mta Turnstile data to find trends in ridership. Given that I was both familiar with pandas and familiar with the dataset (not just because i'm from New York, but because i've actually looked at the data before), I expected the project to be a breeze. This was not the case.
